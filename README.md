# OpenGL Project focusing on animation, lighting, texutres, shadows, reflections

Coded on WebGL using JavaScript for running OpenGL ES 2.0 on the web. 

Below are some previews of code. To run them locally, download asgn4 folder and host the asgn4.html file. 

If preview doesnt load, open the two gifs "animated.gif" and "manual-control.gif" manually. 

## Animated Light Source

In the below gif, the light source moves back and forth illuminating the area. You can see the shadow forming behind the magma blocks (which you can find in the nether in minecraft) which are on the right. 
You can also see the specular highlights on the big brown ball which follows the light source. 
You can see that only the spaces surronding the light sources light up.

## Manual Movement of Light Source

You can move the light source around in the X, Y and Z direction with sliders. 
You can also adjust the R, G, B values independently to change the color of the light source.
